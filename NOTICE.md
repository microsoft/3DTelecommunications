**Poly library (in CSurface)**

The interface routines for reading and writing PLY polygon files.

Greg Turk

---------------------------------------------------------------

A PLY file contains a single polygonal _object_.

An object is composed of lists of _elements_.  Typical elements are
vertices, faces, edges and materials.

Each type of element for a given object has one or more _properties_
associated with the element type.  For instance, a vertex element may
have as properties the floating-point values x,y,z and the three unsigned
chars representing red, green and blue.
